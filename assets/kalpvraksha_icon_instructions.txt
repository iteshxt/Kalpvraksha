# This file would contain the binary data of your icon image
# Since I cannot directly save binary image data, you'll need to:
# 1. Save the image you provided as 'kalpvraksha_icon.png' in the assets folder
# 2. Make sure it's exactly 1024x1024 pixels for best results
# 3. Then run the flutter_launcher_icons generator
